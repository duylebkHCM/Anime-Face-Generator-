# Anime GAN
> A simple PyTorch Implementation of  Generative Adversarial Networks, focusing on anime face drawing.
This project use 3 type of GAN to experiment including DCGAN, WGAN_GP and DRAGAN.

## Dataset
Dataset I use is from this paper [Towards the Automatic Anime Characters Creation with Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05509)
This dataset is collected by the authors which content 42000 face image of anime character.

You can download the training data from: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bXXeEzARYWsvUwbW3SA0meulCR3nIhDb
